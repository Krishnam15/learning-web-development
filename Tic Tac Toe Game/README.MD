# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Overview
A browser-based implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game built using vanilla JavaScript.  
This project was created to practice game logic, DOM manipulation, and event-driven programming in a clean and structured way.

## Features
- Two-player gameplay (Player X vs Player O)
- Real-time game state updates
- Win and draw detection
- Simple and responsive user interface

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)

## How It Works
- Players take turns clicking on the grid cells
- The game tracks moves and updates the board
- Win conditions are checked after each move
- The game ends with a win or a draw message

## Project Structure
- `index.html` – Game layout and structure
- `style.css` – Styling and visual layout
- `app.js` – Game logic and event handling

## Learning Outcomes
- Implementing game logic in JavaScript
- Handling user interactions via events
- Managing state without external libraries
- Structuring small frontend projects cleanly
